### What is Hacktoberfest?

[Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/) is a month-long celebration of open source software. You have to register and make five pull requests to any github repo (including this one!) in the month of october. If you do that you get a tshirt :tshirt: and stickers for your laptop :computer: . Sounds interesting? Let's do it then!

### Wait...what is github?

I get it. You are new to this whole thing. But don't worry, here is a great [guide](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/) to help you understand.

### Contribution Guide

To Contribute in a proper way so that I can merge the pull request:

1. Star the repo! :star:
2. Fork it. (Important!) [What is that?](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/)
3. Add an algorithm/data structure Problem Program.
4. Do not Add Repeated Programs.
6. Make a pull request. [What is that?](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork/)
7. Done!


#### Happy Hacktoberfest :tada: :fireworks:
